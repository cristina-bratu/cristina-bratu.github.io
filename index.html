Welcome to my website! <br /> <br />

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at <a href="http://www.nek.uu.se/?languageId=1"> Uppsala University</a>. I am a labor economist and my work is mostly on immigration questions. <br /> <br />

Take a look at my CV <a href=../assets/files/CBratu_CV.pdf> here</a>.
