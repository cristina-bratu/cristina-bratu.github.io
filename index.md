### Working papers

Firm- and individual-level responses to labor immigration. <em> New version coming soon </em>

<!-- Labor immigration is an important tool that countries can use to address labor shortages. The design of labor immigration policies may affect flows and the composition of immigrant workers, which can in turn have an effect on firms and workers in the host country. I quantify such effects by studying a major Swedish reform that made it significantly easier for firms to recruit non-Europeans. Using a difference-in-differences setup, I exploit variation in the strictness of immigration rules which affected industries differentially before and after the reform. Treated industries are predominantly lower-skilled, and concentrated in sectors like hotels and restaurants and retail trade sectors. Using linked employer-employee data, I study the effect of the reform on both firm-level and individual-level outcomes. I find that the mean earnings at firms in treated industries unambiguously increase. Firms also seem to take advantage of skill complementarities between natives and immigrants and intensify their overall hiring of high-skilled workers. Moreover, I follow native incumbents' employment and earnings over time and find heterogeneous effects along the skill and age dimensions.

[The intergenerational mobility of immigrants and the native-born: evidence from Sweden](../assets/files/Bolotnyy_Bratu_IGM_20190802.pdf) (with [Valentin Bolotnyy](https://www.valentinbolotnyy.com/)) 

<!-- We use administrative Swedish data to show that, conditional on parent income, immigrant children have similar incomes and higher educational attainment in adulthood than native-born Swedes. This result, however, masks the fact that immigrant children born into poor families are more likely than similar natives to both reach the top of the income distribution and to stay at the bottom. Immigrant children from high-income families are also more likely than natives to regress to the economic bottom. Notably, however, children from predominantly-refugee sending countries like Bosnia, Syria, and Iran have higher intergenerational mobility than the average immigrant child in Sweden.
