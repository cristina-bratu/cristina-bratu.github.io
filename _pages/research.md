[**Firm- and individual-level responses to labor immigration**](../assets/files/Bratu_jmp.pdf)) (*Job market paper*)

Labor immigration is an important tool countries can use to address labor shortages that arise due to aging populations and increased age dependency ratios. The design of labor immigration policies may affect flows and the composition of immigrant workers, which can in turn have an effect on firms and workers in the host country. I quantify such effects by studying a major Swedish reform that put firms in the center of the decision-making process. Using a difference-in-differences setup, I exploit variation in the strictness of the rules that affected industries differentially before and after the reform. Treated industries are predominantly lower-skilled, concentrated in sectors like hotels and restaurants and retail trade sectors. Using linked employer-employee data, I study the effect of the reform both on firm-level and on individual-level outcomes. I find mean earnings at firms in treated industries unambiguously go up. Firms also seem to take advantage of complementarities between natives and immigrants and intensify their hiring of high-skilled workers. I further follow native incumbents' employment and earnings over time and find heterogeneous effects along the skill and age dimensions. Both low-skilled and high-skilled domestic workers tend to have higher earnings, with the latter experiencing a relatively larger increase. Young low-skilled natives are less complementary to the newcomers than older low-skilled. Overall, results are largely consistent with skill complementarity models. 

[**Spillover effects of immigration policies**](https://www.ifau.se/globalassets/pdf/se/2018/wp2018-13-spillover-effects-of-stricter-immigration-policies.pdf) (with [Matz Dahlberg](https://katalog.uu.se/profile/?id=N94-1712), [Mattias Engdahl](https://www.ifau.se/en/About-IFAU/Personnel/Researchers-Research-Officers/Mattias-Engdahl/) and [Till Nikolka](http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/CESifo-Group/ifo/ifo-Mitarbeiter/cvifo-nikolka_t.html))

We evaluate the importance of spillover effects of national migration policies by estimating the effect of stricter rules on family reunification in Denmark in 2002 on migration to neighboring countries. We reach two main conclusions. First, we show that stricter rules for reunification lead to a clear and significant increase in emigration of Danish citizens with immigrant background. Most of the emigrants left Denmark for Sweden, a neighboring country in which reunification was possible. Second, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of the individuals that came to Sweden to reunite with a partner left the country again; within two (eight) years around 20% (50%) had left, with the absolute majority leaving for Denmark. Our results indicate that potential spillover effects from national migration policies should be taken into account when forming migration policy.

[**The intergenerational mobility of immigrants and the native-born: evidence from Sweden**](../assets/files/Bolotnyy_Bratu_IGM.pdf) (with [Valentin Bolotnyy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/bolotnyy))

We use administrative Swedish data to show that, conditional on parent income, immigrant children have similar incomes and higher educational attainment in adulthood than native-born Swedes. This result, however, masks the fact that immigrant children born into poor families are more likely than similar natives to both reach the top of the income distribution and to stay at the bottom. Immigrant children from high-income families are also more likely than natives to regress to the economic bottom. Notably, however, children from predominantly-refugee sending countries like Bosnia, Syria, and Iran have higher intergenerational mobility than the average immigrant child in Sweden.
