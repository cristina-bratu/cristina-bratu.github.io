[**Spillover effects of immigration policies**](https://www.ifau.se/globalassets/pdf/se/2018/wp2018-13-spillover-effects-of-stricter-immigration-policies.pdf) (with Matz Dahlberg, [Mattias Engdahl](https://www.ifau.se/en/About-IFAU/Personnel/Researchers-Research-Officers/Mattias-Engdahl/) and [Till Nikolka](http://www.cesifo-group.de/ifoHome/CESifo-Group/ifo/ifo-Mitarbeiter/cvifo-nikolka_t.html))

*Abstract*&nbsp;&nbsp;We evaluate the importance of spillover effects of national migration policies by estimating the effect of stricter rules on family reunification in Denmark in 2002 on migration to neighboring countries. We reach two main conclusions. First, we show that stricter rules for reunification lead to a clear and significant increase in emigration of Danish citizens with immigrant background. Most of the emigrants left Denmark for Sweden, a neighboring country in which reunification was possible. Second, we demonstrate that a significant fraction of the individuals that came to Sweden to reunite with a partner left the country again; within two (eight) years around 20% (50%) had left, with the absolute majority leaving for Denmark. Our results indicate that potential spillover effects from national migration policies should be taken into account when forming migration policy.

[**The intergenerational mobility of immigrants and the native-born: evidence from Sweden**](../assets/files/Bolotnyy_Bratu_IGM.pdf) (with [Valentin Bolotnyy](https://scholar.harvard.edu/bolotnyy))

*Abstract*&nbsp;&nbsp;We use administrative Swedish data to show that, conditional on parent income, immigrant children have similar incomes and higher educational attainment in adulthood than native-born Swedes. This result, however, masks the fact that immigrant children born into poor families are more likely than similar natives to both reach the top of the income distribution and to stay at the bottom. Immigrant children from high-income families are also more likely than natives to regress to the economic bottom. Notably, however, children from predominantly-refugee sending countries like Bosnia, Syria, and Iran have higher intergenerational mobility than the average immigrant child in Sweden.
